# About This Repository

This repository is my **unstructured, high-speed log** of ongoing LeetCode practice. Unlike my main LeetCode repo - [LeetCode Jog](https://github.com/aryan04-t/LeetCode-Jog), this one focuses more on **coding volume, consistency, and competitive programming velocity**, documentation and optimization notes can be skipped in the case of logics which I have known from a long time.


## Purpose

I created LeetCode Dump to keep my workflow fast:

- 🚀 **Least documentation** - just raw solutions  
- ⚡ **Quick commits** - for practice tracking  
- 🧠 **CP-oriented pace** - solve more, explain less  
- 📌 **Zero maintenance** - structure could fumble, polishing could be ignored, as velocity is the main purpose - but I will try to maintain the repo's quality as much as possible 


## What This Repo Contains

Only readable code. Least explanations for known topics, Least formatting - just a real-time record of my LeetCode grind.

### File Naming Convention

Files use snake_case: `{number}_{approach}_{main_concepts}.cpp`

### File Structure
```cpp
// LeetCode (3751. Total Waviness of Numbers in Range I)
// https://leetcode.com/problems/total-waviness-of-numbers-in-range-i

// TAGS: [RATING: 1404], [MEDIUM], [OPTIMAL], [MATH], [STRING]

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    // ... code
};

// T.C. = O(n*k)
// S.C. = O(k)
```

Each file contains: problem link → tags → code → complexity analysis.

## Tag System

Each solution file includes a structured tag comment at the top for quick filtering and topic targeting:
```
TAGS: { [RATING], [DIFFICULTY], [APPROACH], [...ERRORS], [STL], [...CONCEPTS, ...DATA SCTRUCTURES, ...PATTERNS] }
```

### Tag Categories

> Note: All tag names should stay ALL CAPS everywhere in repo

- **RATING**: Question rating (number) derived from [LeetCode Difficulty Rating extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hedijgjklbddpidomdhhngflipnibhca?utm_source=item-share-cb), or `N/A`
- **DIFFICULTY**: `EASY` | `MEDIUM` | `HARD`
- **APPROACH**: `NAIVE` | `NAIVE OPTIMAL` | `OPTIMAL` | `MOST OPTIMAL`
- **ERRORS**: `TLE ERROR` | `MLE ERROR` | (empty if none)
- **STL**: `STL` | (Empty if no uncommon stl function used)
- **CONCEPTS, Data Structures & PATTERNS**: Problem-specific tags

## 📝 NOTE:  
> You can add a `Learnings.md` or a `References.md` to any questions folder if you want to store some data which you think was very helful in solving/understanding that question 


## ⚠️ WARNING:   
> Don't rename an already commited folder or file, because the links of those folders/files are refered at multiple markdowns files inside and outside this repo, and changing already commited folder/file names can break those links - so, be careful before doing something like this 

> Don't even rename the `repo` or `master` branch ever, because the links are dependant on that also - but if you choose to rename these things, then make sure to update all links even in other repos as well like `LeetCode Jog`
