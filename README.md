# About This Repository

This repository is my **unstructured, high-speed log** of ongoing LeetCode practice. Unlike my main LeetCode repo, this one focuses purely on **coding volume, consistency, and competitive programming velocity**, without any documentation or optimization notes.

## Purpose

I created LeetCode Dump to keep my workflow fast:

- 🚀 **No documentation** — just raw solutions  
- ⚡ **Quick commits** — for practice tracking  
- 🧠 **CP-oriented pace** — solve more, explain less  
- 📌 **Zero maintenance** — no structure, no polishing  

## What This Repo Contains

Only code. No explanations, no formatting — just a real-time record of my LeetCode grind.
